# TSic-306-ESP32-Room-Heater
This doesn't utilize a PID loop and in return has pretty bad hysteresis, so it should only be used as example code for the Arduino IDE. I'm currently using this to drive a Crydom D2425 that is connected to an Amazon Basics 500W heater. 

Thanks to lebuni and other collaborators for work on the library! (https://github.com/lebuni/ZACwire-Library)
